# Allegorithmic Bitmap2Material (B2M) 1.6 For Unity
 
 Allegorithmic Bitmap2Material (B2M) 1.6 for Unity     
Bitmap2Material (B2M) is a powerful tool that allows you to generate PBR materials from a single bitmap image. You can use it to create realistic and customizable textures for your 3D models, such as diffuse, normal, specular, height, and ambient occlusion maps. B2M can also generate seamless tiling textures from any input image, and adjust the lighting and colors to match your scene.

B2M is developed by Allegorithmic, a company that specializes in creating tools and software for creating procedural textures and materials. Allegorithmic also offers other products such as Substance Designer, Substance Painter, and Substance Player.
     
B2M can be used in different ways, depending on your needs and preferences. You can use it as a standalone application, as a plugin for Photoshop, or as a substance file that can be imported and used in Unity.
     
## B2M as a standalone application
     
If you want to use B2M as a standalone application, you can download the Substance Player from Allegorithmic's website. The Substance Player is a free tool that allows you to open and edit any substance file, including B2M. You can also export the resulting textures as bitmaps in various formats.
     
To use B2M in the Substance Player, you need to load your input image and adjust the parameters to your liking. You can preview the results in real time and see how they look on different 3D models. You can also change the resolution and format of the output textures before exporting them.
     
## B2M as a Photoshop plugin
     
If you prefer to use B2M within Photoshop, you can install the B2M plugin from Allegorithmic's website. The plugin adds a new menu item in Photoshop that allows you to access B2M's features. You can use B2M on any layer or selection in Photoshop, and apply filters and adjustments to the output textures.

To use B2M in Photoshop, you need to select the layer or selection that contains your input image and choose Bitmap2Material from the Filter menu. A new window will open where you can adjust the parameters and preview the results. You can also switch between different output channels and see how they affect your image. When you are done, you can click OK to apply B2M to your layer or selection.
     
## B2M as a substance file in Unity
     
If you want to use B2M directly in Unity, you can purchase the B2M substance file from the Asset Store. The substance file is a special type of asset that contains both the input image and the parameters of B2M. You can import it into your project and use it as a material for your 3D models.
     
To use B2M in Unity, you need to drag and drop the substance file into your project folder. Then, you can assign it to any 3D model in your scene. You can also modify the parameters of B2M in the Inspector window and see how they affect your material. You don't need to export any bitmaps, as the textures are generated on the fly by Unity.
     
### Advantages of using B2M as a substance file in Unity
     
- You can save disk space and memory by using a single substance file instead of multiple bitmap files.
- You can easily tweak the parameters of B2M without leaving Unity or opening another application.
- You can create variations of your material by changing the seed value of B2M's random generator.
- You can benefit from Unity's built-in support for substances, such as automatic compression, LODs, batching, etc.

### Limitations of using B2M as a substance file in Unity

- You need to have a Pro license of B2M to use it in Unity. The Indie Pack on the Asset Store only includes a Standard license.
- You may encounter some bugs or issues with exporting bitmaps from B2M inside Unity. Allegorithmic is working on fixing them in future updates.
- You may experience some performance issues if you use too many substances or high-resolution textures in your scene. You can optimize your substances by reducing the resolution, disabling unused channels, or baking them into bitmaps.

## Conclusion
     
B2M is a versatile and powerful tool that can help you create realistic and customizable materials for your 3D models. You can use it in different ways, depending on your workflow and preferences. You can also integrate it with Unity and take advantage of its features and benefits. B2M is available for purchase on Allegorithmic's website or on the Asset Store.
